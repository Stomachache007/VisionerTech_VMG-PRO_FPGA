## Visionertech VMG-PRO FPGA project
## General Description:
This is a open-source project of VMG-PRO HMD which is mostly writed by verilog. There are two process flow contained, one is basic ISP flow, the other is HDR flow.
The top-hierarchy file is also provided in the project, what developers use to do is only new a project and add all of the RTL and ip files to start their design. By the way, all of the module included have been simulated and tested already in hardware.
